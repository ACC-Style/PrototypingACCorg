<p id="p5955"><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p id="p5960">HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%) is highly prevalent, accounting for up to 50% of all patients with HF, and
	is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib959"
		data-tab="pane-pcw-references">14</a>). HFpEF is a heterogenous disorder, contributed to by
	comorbidities that include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, CAD, CKD, and specific causes such as
	cardiac amyloidosis (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib960" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">15-17</a>).
	Clinical trials have used variable definitions of HFpEF (e.g., LVEF ≥40%, 45%, or 50%, and the varying
	need for accompanying evidence of structural heart disease or elevated levels of natriuretic peptides)
	(<a class="tab-link" href="#bib963" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">18</a>). Until recently, clinical
	trials had been generally disappointing, with no benefit on mortality and marginal benefits on HF
	hospitalizations (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib950" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">5</a>,<a
		class="tab-link" href="#bib953" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">8</a>,<a class="tab-link"

		data-tab="pane-pcw-references">19</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib965"
		data-tab="pane-pcw-references">20</a>). Currently, recommended management is that used for HF in
	general with use of diuretics to reduce congestion and improve symptoms (see <a class="ref sec"
		id="crosref6785" href="#sec11.1.1">Section 7.1.1</a> for recommendations for nonpharmacological
	management and <a class="ref sec" id="crosref6790" href="#sec11.2">Section 7.2</a> for recommendations
	for diuretics), identification and treatment of specific causes such as amyloidosis, and management of

		<p id="p5970">The role of blood pressure control is well established for the prevention of
			HF, as well as for reduction of other cardiovascular events and HF mortality in patients
			without prevalent baseline HF (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib946"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">1-3</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib966"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">21-24</a>). The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure
			Intervention) trial and meta-analyses established that more intensive blood pressure
			control in patients with high cardiovascular risk significantly reduces HF and other
			cardiovascular outcomes (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib947"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">2</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib948"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">3</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib970"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">25</a>). In recent clinical practice guidelines for
			hypertension, blood pressure targets in HFpEF are extrapolated from those for treatment
			of patients with hypertension in general (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib971"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">26</a>). However, the optimal blood pressure goal and
			antihypertensive regimens are not known for patients with HFpEF. RAAS antagonists
			including ACEi, ARB, MRA, and possibly ARNi, could be first-line agents given experience
			with their use in HFpEF trials (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib953"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">8</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib955"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">10</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib961"

				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">27</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib973"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">28</a>). Beta blockers may be used to treat
			hypertension in patients with a history of MI (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib972"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">27</a>), symptomatic CAD, or AF with rapid
			ventricular response. These effects need to be balanced with the potential contribution
			of chronotropic incompetence to exercise intolerance in some patients (<a
				class="tab-link" href="#bib974" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">29</a>).</p>
	</li>


	
	<li>
		<p id="p5975">EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart
			Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) showed a significant benefit of the SGLT2i,
			empagliflozin, in symptomatic patients with HF with LVEF &gt;40% and elevated
			natriuretic peptides (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib975"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">30</a>). The 21% reduction in the primary composite
			endpoint of time to HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death was driven mostly by a
			significant 29% reduction in time to HF hospitalization (nonsignificant lower
			cardiovascular death [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76-1.0]), with no benefit on all-cause
			mortality. Empagliflozin also resulted in a significant reduction in total HF
			hospitalizations, decrease in the slope of the eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in
			QOL at 52 weeks. Of note, the benefit was similar irrespective of the presence or
			absence of diabetes at baseline. Although the benefit in the primary endpoint did not
			have a significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (&lt;50%, 50%–&lt;60%, and &gt;60%) (<a
				class="tab-link" href="#bib975" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">30</a>), in a
			subgroup analysis by EF, there was a signal for lower benefit on the primary composite
			endpoint, first and recurrent HF hospitalizations at higher LVEFs &gt;62.5% (<a
				class="tab-link" href="#bib976" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">31</a>).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p id="p5980">Large, randomized clinical trial data are unavailable to specifically guide
			therapy in patients with HFpEF and AF. Currently, the comprehensive care of AF can be
			extrapolated from the clinical practice guidelines for AF, with individualization of
			strategies for rate or rhythm control in patients with HFpEF (see also <a
				class="ref sec" id="crosref6880" href="#sec14.2">Section 10.2</a>, “Management of
			Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in HF,” for HF specific recommendations for AF). Although beta
			blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are often considered as
			first-line agents for heart rate control in patients with HFpEF, a recent smaller
			open-label trial, RATE-AF in elderly patients with AF and symptoms of HF (most with
			preserved LVEF), compared the use of the beta blocker, bisoprolol, to digoxin (<a
				class="tab-link" href="#bib977" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">32</a>). At 6 months,
			the primary endpoint of QOL was similar between the 2 groups. However, several secondary
			QOL endpoints, functional capacity, and reduction in NT-proBNP favored digoxin at 12
			months. There was a similar heart rate reduction in both groups. Of note, more adverse
			events such as higher rates of dizziness, lethargy, and hypotension occurred with beta
			blockers than digoxin. The comprehensive care of AF is beyond the scope of these
			guidelines. AF-specific care recommendations can be found in separate ACC/AHA clinical
			practice guidelines (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib978"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">33</a>,<a class="tab-link" href="#bib979"

		<p id="p5985">MRAs improve diastolic function in patients with HFpEF (<a class="tab-link"
				href="#bib980" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">35</a>). The TOPCAT trial investigated
			the effects of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF. The small reduction (HR, 0.89) in
			the composite of death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitalization was not
			statistically significant, although HF hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83); adverse
			effects of hyperkalemia and increasing creatinine levels were more common in the
			treatment group (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib950"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">5</a>). A post hoc analysis (<a class="tab-link"
				href="#bib951" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">6</a>) showed efficacy in the Americas
			(HR 0.83) but not in Russia-Georgia (HR 1.10). A sample of the Russia-Georgia population
			in the active treatment arm had nondetectable levels of a spironolactone metabolite.
			Post hoc analyses have limitations, but they suggest a possibility of benefit in
			appropriately selected patients with symptomatic HFpEF (LVEF ≥45%, elevated BNP level or
			HF admission within 1 year, eGFR &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, creatinine &lt;2.5
			mg/dL, and potassium &lt;5.0 mEq/L). Furthermore, another post hoc analysis suggested
			that the potential efficacy of spironolactone was greatest at the lower end of the LVEF
			spectrum (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib952" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">7</a>).
			Careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and
			follow-up are key to minimizing the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function.

		<p id="p5990">Although RAAS inhibition strategies have been successful in the treatment of

				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">37</a>), clinical trials with RAAS inhibition have
			not showed much benefit in patients HFpEF. In the CHARM-Preserved (Candesartan in
			patients with chronic HF and preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction) trial,
			patients with LVEF &gt;40% were randomized to an ARB, candesartan, or to placebo (<a
				class="tab-link" href="#bib983" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">38</a>). The primary
			endpoint (cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization) was not significantly different
			between the 2 groups (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77–1.03, <i>P</i>=0.118; covariate-adjusted
			HR, 0.86; <i>P</i>=0.051). Cardiovascular mortality was identical in the 2 groups; HF
			hospitalizations were lower in the candesartan arm, with borderline statistical
			significance on the covariate-adjusted analysis only (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00;
			<i>P</i>=0.047; unadjusted <i>P</i>=0.072). The number of individuals hospitalized for
			HF (reported by the investigator) was lower in the candesartan group than placebo (230
			versus 279; <i>P</i>=0.017). A post hoc analysis of the CHARM trials showed that
			improvement in outcomes with candesartan was greater at the lower end the LVEF spectrum
			(<a class="tab-link" href="#bib984" data-tab="pane-pcw-references">39</a>). In a
			meta-analysis of 7694 patients with HFpEF in 4 trials evaluating ARB, there was no
			signal for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.02), all-cause mortality (HR,
			1.02), or HF hospitalization (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83–1.02) (<a class="tab-link"

		<p id="p5995">In the PARAMOUNT-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNi With ARB on Management of
			Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, a phase II RCT in patients with
			HFpEF (LVEF ≥45%), sacubitril-valsartan resulted in a lower level of NT-proBNP after 12
			weeks of treatment compared with the ARB, valsartan (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib987"

			4822 patients with HFpEF (LVEF ≥45%, HF admission within 9 months or elevated
			natriuretic peptide levels, and eGFR ≥30 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>), sacubitril-valsartan
			compared with valsartan did not achieve a significant reduction in the primary composite

			(rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06) (<a class="tab-link" href="#bib955"
				data-tab="pane-pcw-references">10</a>). Given the primary outcome was not met, other
			analyses are exploratory. There was no benefit of sacubitril-valsartan on cardiovascular
			death (HR, 0.95) or total mortality (HR, 0.97). There was a signal of benefit for the
			ARNi for HF hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.056). The
			occurrence of hyperkalemia and the composite outcome of decline in renal function
			favored sacubitril-valsartan, but it was associated with a higher incidence of
			hypotension and angioedema. In prespecified subgroup analyses, a differential effect by
			LVEF and sex was noted. A benefit of sacubitril-valsartan compared with valsartan was
			observed in patients with LVEF below the median (45%–57%; rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI,
			0.64–0.95), and in women (rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90) (<a class="tab-link"

		<p id="p6000">Nitrate therapy can reduce pulmonary congestion and improve exercise tolerance
