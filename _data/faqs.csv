"I am an interventional cardiologist who has maintained my Board certification, but I stopped doing procedures 2 years ago, and I no longer meet the volume criteria for Interventional certification. What do I do?","<p>You would enter the new Board’s continuous certification competency-based pathway in a five-year cycle in general cardiology. Once the new Board is active, it is certainly possible that consideration could be given to a continuous competency process for individuals who want to maintain a cardiovascular subspecialty certification without a designation to perform procedures.</p>","13"
"I  am a ""grandparent"" initially certified before 1990 and have not been participating in MOC, what do I do to retain my certification?","<p>You would enter the new Board’s continuous competency pathway in a five-year cycle. See “What will the new Board’s continuous competency program look like?”</p>","12"
"I am participating in ABIM’s Longitudinal Knowledge Assessment (LKA) for maintaining my cardiovascular certification(s). Do I continue the same process for now?","<p>If you are participating in the LKA, continue with the LKA. If the new Board is approved, a process will be implemented for seamless transition to the new Board’s continuous competency program. No existing credit or status will be lost.</p>","11"
"I am participating in Collaborative Maintenance Pathway (CMP) for maintaining my cardiovascular certification(s). Do I just continue the same process for now?","<p>If you are participating in the CMP, continue with the CMP. If the new Board is approved, a process will be implemented for seamless transition to the new Board’s continuous competency program. No existing credit or status will be lost.</p>","10"
"I have been maintaining my cardiovascular certification(s) through the 10-year exam and participating in MOC. If the new Board is approved, will I need to take another certifying exam?","<p>The continuous certification competency-based program for the new Board will not require taking any new exams or any future exams, so long as diplomates complete the requirements for the program within the five-year cycle. If you are participating in the 10-year exam pathway, continue with the 10-year pathway. If the new Board is approved, a process will be implemented for seamless transition to the new Board’s continuous competency program. No existing credit or status will be lost.</p>","09"
"Will the Board’s requirements take up more time? How much will it cost?","<p>The new certification(s) have been designed specifically with cardiovascular professionals in mind, meaning the requirements also prioritize convenience, choice and credit for learning. Pricing will be determined once the new Board application has been accepted, but it is our goal that the price will be lower than what physicians are currently paying, and the value will be exponential.</p>","08"
"Who will govern the Board?","<p>The new Board will be governed by a board of directors comprising cardiovascular professionals who are representative of clinical expertise for the various cardiovascular certifications offered. More specific details forthcoming over the next few months.</p>","07"
"If the new Board is approved, will cardiologists still need to obtain their certification in internal medicine?","<p>Eligibility to sit for a cardiology certification currently requires an internal medicine certification. There is no plan to change that requirement when the new Board becomes active.</p>","06"
"Will the new Board offer certifications in other related areas of cardiology?","<p>Once the new Board is active, it is certainly possible that additional certifications related to cardiology could be added. Such decisions will be the purview of the certifying Board’s independent board of directors.</p>","05"
"If the new Board is approved, will cardiologists have a choice of moving to the new Board or staying with ABIM?","<p><strong>No.</strong> The ABMS publishes requirements to which all its member boards adhere. These requirements state that only one medical specialty board will be recognized in each specialty. Therefore, if the new CV Board is approved, all cardiologists wishing to secure and maintain a Board certification in general cardiology, interventional cardiology, clinical cardiac electrophysiology, advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology, and adult congenital heart disease must adhere to the requirements of the new CV Board.</strong>","04"
"What will the new Board’s continuous certification competency-based program look like?","<p>The new Board’s continuous certification competency-based program requirements are designed to offer diplomates convenience, support, choice and credit for the learning that physicians already do to keep their knowledge and skills at the highest levels. </p>
<p>There are no timed, high stakes performance exams. Instead, there would be learning assessments to identify gaps in current knowledge or skills, then recommendations offered of CME learning resources and activities to help close those gaps. </p>
<p>More information, as well as videos and webinars, will be available on CVBoard.org over the coming weeks.</p>","03"
"What is the timeframe for standing up a new Board?","<p>There is a formal application process for reviewing and evaluating applications for approval of new ABMS medical specialty boards. We expect that process to take 8-12 months. If an approval is granted, then it would be several more months before the formation of the new Board is complete and would begin offering initial certification and supporting continuous competency programs.</p>","02"
"Why now?","<p>The field of cardiology has evolved as its own distinct specialty, separate from internal medicine. Having a separate and distinct medical Board is best for cardiovascular professionals and their patients. The new Board will ensure clinical excellence by meeting the unique needs of today’s cardiovascular professionals and the patients they serve.</p>","01"
