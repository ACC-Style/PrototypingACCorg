    <p>
    ACC will treat your  personal information in accordance with our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F49677817FCC4259A63A243C49B14B5F&amp;_z=z">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

    <li>Term  and Termination</li>
    <p>
    Unless otherwise specified  on the Services (or other agreement between you and ACC overriding the terms of  this Agreement), your access to the Services will continue until one of the  following occurs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>your membership, subscription, or other access to the Services expires and you have not chosen to renew your membership, subscription, or other access to the Services;</li>
        <li>	your purchase of products available on or through, or membership, subscription, or other access to the Services is cancelled by ACC or by you for any reason; </li>
        <li> ACC discontinues the products available on or through the Services or the Services; or</li>
        <li> you or ACC terminates this Agreement.</li>
    </ul>
    You may cancel your access to the Services at any time by notifying ACC in any of the following manners:
    <ul>
        <li>By email:  at <a href="mailto:membercare@acc.org">membercare@acc.org</a></li>

    <p>
    ACC may terminate your  access to Services at any time. If ACC has reason to believe that you have  violated any of the terms of this Agreement, you will not be credited with a  refund.

    <p>
    This agreement is personal  to you, and you may not assign your rights or obligations to anyone.</p>
    <li>No  Waiver</li>
    <p>
    Neither failure nor delay  on the part of any party to exercise any right, remedy, power, or privilege  hereunder nor course of dealing between the parties shall operate as a waiver  thereof, or of the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
