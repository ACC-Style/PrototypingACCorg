        <p>I am so honored to serve as the ACC WIC Leadership Council and
            Section Chair for 2022 to 2025. I am dedicated to enhancing our
            profession by engaging, preparing, and promoting women in
            leadership, achieving gender and career equity, enhancing
            professional development and encouraging wellness.</p>

        <p>Since 1995, I have been an active Fellow of the American College of
            Cardiology. I have served on the national ACC Women in Cardiology
            (WIC) Leadership Council and served as Co-Chair on the
            Communications and Social Media Committee of the ACC WIC
            Section.</p>

        <p>I have long been a fighter for gender equity for women in medicine
            and this had led me to be devotedly supportive of diversity in all
            areas, especially gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual
            preference. <strong>My intention is for the ACC WIC Section to
                support women cardiologists of all ages, all stages and all
                subspecialties.</strong></p>

        <p>My strategic goals for ACC WIC is to 1- increase our WIC Section
            membership and to increase our international women membership. Not
            all female cardiologist are members of the WIC Section. Some women
            wonder what is in it for them and what benefit is the WIC Section
            membership. There is a lot of misinformation that WIC is about women
            who specialize in cardiovascular diseases in women or WIC is just
            focused on childbearing and work -life balance. But WIC is here to
            increase the professional opportunities for women, promote
            leadership, enhance career development and achieve gender equity for
            female cardiologists.</p>

        <p>Another goal is 2- attracting more women to the subspecialties of IC
            and EP. Better patient care through a more diverse workforce is an
            ACC platform and we need more women and especially more women of
            color in the IC and EP areas. Highlighting women in these areas will
            attract more women and FITs. I want all women in all subspecialties
            to feel supported by WIC.</p>

        <p>I want WIC to 3- support women of all ages and stages. By this I mean
            we need to attract more women into medicine and increase women in
            cardiology training programs. Supporting FITs and Early Career is
            vital to increasing our numbers and ensuring the future for WIC. But
            we also need to support and retain Mid-career and Senior Career
            women who may be struggling with promotion, grants, research,
            publications, time-management and barriers to leadership. Too many
            women are leaving cardiology careers due to burnout and too many
            senior women are drifting away from mentoring and sponsoring the
            younger women. WIC aims to keep all women engaged and actively
            supporting each other.</p>

        <p>My goals include 4- promoting gender equity and equal pay for our
            WIC. My early career was in private practice and there was no paid
            maternity leave and I was not treated fairly during my pregnancy
            neither by my female nor male colleagues. No woman should be forced
            to take unpaid leave or use vacation time or take excessive call
            post-partum. We will work to promote paid parental leave for all new
            parents and pregnant women. And WIC will strive for increased
            transparency for pay, promotion, leadership positions and in
            research and scholarship opportunities. WIC supports career equity
            for women cardiologists in private practice, employment positions,
            academics and industry.</p>

        <p>Finally, my goals include 5- promoting physician wellness through WIC
            programs and our member website. Having down time and seeking
            pleasure in our personal lives is essential to a strong WIC Section.
            Many of our WIC members are artistic, creative and talented in areas
            outside of STEM. We embrace the diversity of our members and
            celebrate their gifts and encourage a community of women who support
            each other in their personal lives as well as their careers. We call
            this support group the Otter Raft and our goal is to make each WIC
            Section member feel they are essential members of the section.</p>

        <p>I look forward to serving the Council and Section and am open to all
            of our members. I hope to meet all of you at our Scientific
            Sessions, the annual WIC Leadership Conference, the regional WIC
            meetings and on social media. I am here to serve and listen and
            would love to hear your suggestions, stories and opinions.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
