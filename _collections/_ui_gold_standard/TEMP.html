          ACC has
            developed competencies for cardiologists, from training through
            practice, as well as competencies for nurse practitioners and
            physician assistants who are members of the cardiovascular care team,
            defining the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that health care
            providers, patients, the public and applicable accrediting bodies can
            reasonably expect these clinicians to achieve, maintain or
            enhance.
