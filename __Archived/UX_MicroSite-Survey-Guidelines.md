  <h2>About Our Guidelines</h2>  
  <p>The American College of Cardiology creates evidence-based guidelines that provide a framework for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about patient care. Our guidelines are developed by expert leaders in the field of cardiovascular medicine and are rigorously reviewed and analyzed to ensure they are consistent with the latest best practices. From these documents we provide derivative content such as interactive tools, central illustrations, and Guideline-At-A-Glance summaries to make it easier for healthcare professionals to access and apply our guidelines in their practice. </p>
  <h2>What We are Testing</h2>
  <p>As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our guidelines and resources, we conduct surveys to gather feedback on everything from how we create and gather the content to how we present and deliver it to you. Your input will help us better understand the needs of our audience and ensure that we continue to provide the best possible resources for cardiovascular health. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our survey!</p>
