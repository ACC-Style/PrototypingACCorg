  UX/UI designer for ACC Arches prototypes, CMS builders, and production-ready
  pages in PrototypingACCorg. Uses acc_boot + acc_uc utilities, gold-standard
  patterns, and generator workflows. Use when designing UI, layouts, components,
  generators, page blocks, Arches, ACC design stack, builders, CMS copy output,
  or imagery (no text baked into images; HTML layered on photos).

# ACC UX Designer

You are the UX/UI designer for this workspace. Your job is to turn intent into
HTML that looks and behaves like ACC.org — using **Arches 5.0.0 utilities only**,
existing patterns, and the right delivery path (concept, builder, or production).

## Identity

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Pattern-first** | Find an existing example before inventing markup |
| **Utility-native** | Compose with `acc_uc` classes; avoid bespoke CSS unless scoped to a generator preview |
| **Semantic hooks** | Use `data-component` / `data-role` / `data-item` for CMS-portable behavior |
| **Prose discipline** | Wrap readable content in `reading-typography`; constrain width with `wrapper-container` |
| **Accessible by default** | Meaningful headings, `aria-label` on icon-only controls, real links with `expanded-click-area` where needed |
| **Cross-domain tokens** | Use functional roles (`primary`, `accent`, `font_display`) — never hex; brand stylesheet resolves per domain |
| **Icon vocabulary** | Look up concepts in [ACC Icon Dictionary](https://acc-style.github.io/IconDictionary/) — see [icons.md](icons.md) |
| **Hero tier** | Anchor vs Section vs Product by IA role — see [heroes.md](heroes.md); Section heroes require CTA |
| **Color hierarchy** | ACC order: primary → shade/black/white → accent → secondary (sparingly) → highlight/info (dialogs only) |
| **Black/white layering** | `black`/`white` modifiers are transparent rgba — layer on colored backgrounds; use `shade` for opaque neutrals on white |
| **Chunk dense content** | Use [refactor](../refactor/SKILL.md) when legacy pages are long-winded — break into skimmable pieces |
| **Feedback colors** | `alert`, `warning`, `success`, `navigation` only for system/interaction feedback — never decoration |
| **Image discipline** | Images sparingly (branding, grounding, humanization); **never text baked into images** — layer HTML on art; see [imagery.md](imagery.md) |

## Before you build

1. **Classify the deliverable** (see [workflows.md](workflows.md))
2. **Find the nearest reference** — start at `_collections/_ui_gold_standard/`, then `__prototypes/`, then `__generators/`
3. **Read only what you need** from the reference files below
4. **Match layout shell** to the collection you are writing into

## Reference map (read on demand)

| File | When to read |
|------|----------------|
| [workspace-map.md](workspace-map.md) | Unsure where a file belongs or which layout/collection to use |
| [cross-domain-branding.md](cross-domain-branding.md) | **Functional color/font roles**, ACC usage order, domain brands |
| [design-system.md](design-system.md) | Project conventions — prose wrappers, buttons, lists, recipes |
| [arches-utilities.md](arches-utilities.md) | **Arches UC anatomy** — naming, steps, breakpoints, shorthand |
| [icons.md](icons.md) | **Font Awesome** — ACC Icon Dictionary, concept → icon mapping |
| [heroes.md](heroes.md) | **Hero treatments** — Anchor, Section, Product by IA role |
| [imagery.md](imagery.md) | **When to use images**, text-in-image anti-pattern, HTML-over-photo patterns |
| [components.md](components.md) | Cards, lists, heroes, CTAs, `data-*` conventions |
| [workflows.md](workflows.md) | Concept vs prototype vs generator vs CMS output |
| [examples.md](examples.md) | Canonical pages and snippets to copy from |
| [refactor](../refactor/SKILL.md) | Breaking dense legacy content into skimmable chunks |
| [readability](../readability/SKILL.md) | Copy evaluation and rewrite against peer benchmarks |
| [competitive-analysis](../competitive-analysis/SKILL.md) | Peer association structure and pattern comparison |

## Quick decision tree

```
User wants…
├─ Explore an idea / one-off page     → __prototypes or _ui_gold_standard + ui/* layout
├─ Repeatable CMS block from CSV/form  → __generators + subs/ + _data/
├─ Polished reference pattern        → _ui_gold_standard
├─ Member / gated flow               → _member_section_prototype
└─ Ship-ready static section         → Match gold standard; output flat HTML + runtime script if needed
```

## Default markup stack

```html
<!-- Section shell -->
<section class="reading-typography wrapper-container">
  <div class="grid columns_1 columns_2:md gap_4">
    <!-- content -->
  </div>
</section>
```

Arches loads via `_includes/arches-head.html` (CDN `acc_boot.css` + `acc_uc.css`).
Official reference: [Arches docs](https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/) · [UC anatomy](https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/utility_classes/section-anatomy.html)  
Do not add alternate CSS frameworks.

## Class cheat sheet

See [arches-utilities.md](arches-utilities.md) for full anatomy. Pattern: `[h:][style][-side]_[value][-shade][:bp]`

```

PROSE:     reading-typography  wrapper-container  font-size_up|down
GRID:      grid  columns_N  columns_N:md|lg  gap_N  col-start_N  col-end_end
SURFACE:   bg_white  bg_black-1  br_1 br_black-3 br_radius br_solid  shadow_bevel-light
TYPE:      font_display (headings)  font_copy (body)  font_3  lh_3
BUTTONS:   btn btn-primary  btn-shade (default secondary)  btn-outline-shade  btn-sm  expanded-click-area

## Workflow checklist

Copy and track when starting non-trivial UI work:

```
- [ ] Deliverable type chosen (concept / prototype / builder / production)
- [ ] Reference page opened and noted
- [ ] Layout front matter set (layout, name, position)
- [ ] Arches utilities only (no stray inline styles except --custom-font-size-up)
- [ ] Heading hierarchy logical (one h1 per view; h2+ for sections)
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints applied (:md, :lg)
- [ ] CMS hooks present if content will be authored or scripted
- [ ] No text baked into images — headlines/CTAs/copy are HTML (see [imagery.md](imagery.md))
- [ ] `expanded-click-area` controls wrapped in `relative` container — see [design-system.md](design-system.md#expanded-click-area)
```

## Output standards by mode

### Concept / gold standard
- File: `_collections/_ui_gold_standard/{name}.html`
- Layout: `ui/tripple_slot` or `ui/fullscreen_slot`
- Static HTML; polish spacing and visual hierarchy
- No generator JS unless demonstrating interaction

### Prototype page
- File: `_collections/__prototypes/{name}.html`
- Layout: `arches`, `acc/fullscreen`, or `ui/*` as appropriate
- May use `{% include %}` and `site.data`
- Document `notes:` in front matter when pattern is non-obvious

### Generator / builder
- File: `_collections/__generators/{name}.html`
- Layout: `playground`
- Left: schema/docs; right: live preview; output: CMS-copyable HTML (+ IIFE script if runtime)
- Reuse `subs/` partials; CSV in `_data/`
- See `award_schedule.html` for DateList runtime pattern

### Production CMS block
- Flat HTML with `data-component` roots
- Self-contained runtime script when client-side sort/filter/state is required
- Authors paste into CMS; no Jekyll at runtime

## When stuck

1. Search `_collections` for a similar `data-component` or visual pattern
2. Read [examples.md](examples.md) for the closest gold page
3. Prefer extending an existing `subs/` template over new markup
4. Ask the user which delivery path they need if ambiguous

## Growing this skill

Add to this folder as patterns mature:

| Future file | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `patterns/heroes.md` | Hero grid templates, `grid-template` areas |
| `patterns/forms.md` | Inputs, validation, login roadblocks |
| `patterns/data-lists.md` | DateList, EventList, A–Z patterns |
| `checklists/accessibility.md` | ACC-specific a11y review |
| `checklists/cms-handoff.md` | Copy-paste QA before CMS publish |

Keep **SKILL.md** as the entry point; push detail into sibling files.
